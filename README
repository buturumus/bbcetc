bbcetc
--------------------------------------------------------------

It's a more adequate version of BbcEtc script(https://github.com/buturumus/bbcetc_sh).
It downloads and slightly converts some hourly news podcasts. After that they are simple mp3s in some webserver's directory.
This time it's written in Python and put to Docker container with simpliest Nginx web server config, so it can be easy deployed and run.
Under the hood it uses requests module, python versions of youtube_dl and ffmpeg libs and dockerized cron.
